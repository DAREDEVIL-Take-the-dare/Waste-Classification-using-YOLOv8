# Waste-Classification
 waste classification using YOLOv8 and Streamlit offers
 a powerful solution for improving waste management practices. By
 leveraging computer vision, deep learning algorithms, and an
 interactive web interface, we can automate the process of waste
 classification, enhancing recycling efficiency and resource recovery.
 The integration of YOLOv8 for accurate object detection, Streamlit for
 seamless deployment, and other complementary technologies like
 OpenCV creates a comprehensive waste classification system. This
 technology stack enables real-time waste classification, user-friendly
 interactions, and the potential for widespread adoption in various
 waste management scenarios. By adopting these technologies, we
 can make significant strides towards sustainable waste management
 and contribute to a cleaner and greener future
